# Linear_Dimensionality_Reduction
This is my final project for the class STAT 2221 - Advanced Applied Multivariate Analysis by Dr. Joshua Cape (Fall 2021).\
I explored the theoretical basis of several popular linear dimensionality reduction methods, Principal Component Analysis, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Partial Least Squares, and Supervised Principal Component Analysis.\
I then compared their predictive performance on both simulated data and real-life data.\
The file *functions.R* contains user-defined functions that are referred to in the main Mardown file.
